# My Personal .NET Dev Tools
This project is supposed to be a collection of more or less useful tools that are motivated
by my daily work.

Actually there is only one tool since the initialization of the repo... ðŸ˜‚
Feel free to use or raise any issue, if you encounter any trouble.

## WindowsEnvLoader
Simple Tool to open/edit flat JSON files (simple key/value pairs as in Visual Studio's user secrets)
and save the result as user environment variables.

The tool can also be used in console mode:
```powershell
WindowsEnvLoader.exe <JSON file> [--delete | -d] [--yes | -y]
```

Or for more information:
```powershell
WindowsEnvLoader.exe --help
```

This is a merge of the prior Console App and Windows Desktop App (below).

## ~~EnvLoaderWindows~~
~~Windows Forms Application with a minimal User Interface to display and edit environment variables
loaded from a json file or insterted manually.~~

## ~~SetUserEnvVars~~
~~Windows Console tool for loading a flat json object from a file and setting the key/value pairs as
corresponding environment vars.~~

~~This project also acts as library for the Windows registry manipulations necessary for setting and 
unsetting user environment vars (Windows only!). As such it is a dependency of the EnvLoaderWindows 
above.~~
